# Iterator Drill: Map

## Learning Goals

* Define how the `map()` method works
* Demonstrate `map()` with `Array`s
* Demonstrate `map()` with complex data structures


## Introduction

Iterating over arrays is a very common task we will find ourselves
performing as developers. Using `for` loops, can get tedious after
a while. Rather than using `for` loops and nesting to process data
in lists and collections, you can take advantage a method like `map()`
to better organize your logic into building blocks of functions,
and then chain them to create more readable and understandable
implementations.

## Define How the `map()` Method Works

`Array.prototype.map()` is an array method that iterates over all elements,
allowing you to apply a function to each element in that array, effectively
transforming them into something else. The result is then returned as a *new*
array, leaving the original array intact and unmodified (but remember, **not**
the elements we modify, necessitating the need for defensive copying). That
last part is super important, because it either saves us from having to create
a new array ourselves and copy stuff in there, **or** modifying the original
elements in the array

## Demonstrate `map()` with `Array`s

We use `map()` when we want to perform some operation on each element in the
collection, and "gather" the results into a new `Array`.

We'll also use this as a chance to demonstrate some of the power of
functions in JavaScript. We'll write `map()` **four times** so you can see how
the iterator functions allow us to write more _expressive_ code.

### `for` and `for...of`

In this example, we are using a standard bit of iteration code. Because
`for ` and `for...of` are _general_ functions that can be used to do lots
of things another programmer won't be sure if the inner workings' return
values are important or not.

```js
let students = [harryPotter, ronWeasley, hermioneGranger, ginevraWeasley];
let patroni = []; // Patroni, sg. patronus

for (const student of students) {
  patroni.push( student.namePatronus() );
}

//=> patroni = ["Stag", "Jack Russell Terrier", "Otter", "Horse"];
```

When we write `.map()` we are saying to other programmers: expect a new array
to come out of this thing after each element is touched! Let's use that more
expressive function name.

### `map()` and a function declaration

```js
function studentPatronusName(student) {
  return student.namePatronus();
}

let students = [harryPotter, ronWeasley, hermioneGranger, ginevraWeasley];
let patroni = students.map(studentPatronusName);
//=> patroni = ["Stag", "Jack Russell Terrier", "Otter", "Horse"];
```

With `map()` we're passing a function _as an argument_. Yes, arguments can be
things like `Number` or `String`...but, in JavaScript, **can also** be
**work**. Very few other programming languages allow that! That's worthy of a
Keanu "Whoa."

The iterator functions like `map()` expect to be _passed a function as an
argument_ which they will hand each of their elements off to. In the case of
`map()` it hands each element to the function and captures the return value of
the function into a new `Array`.

This code is more expressive because it lives up to the promise of map. It
creates a new `Array` after each element is "touched" by a function.

One drawback to this code is that the `studentPatronusName` function doesn't do
much work. It just returns something that the `student` _already_ knew how to
do.  What if we use a function expression ("anonymous function") instead?

### `map` and a function expression

```js
let students = [harryPotter, ronWeasley, hermioneGranger, ginevraWeasley];
let patroni = students.map(function(student) {
  return student.namePatronus();
});
//=> patroni = ["Stag", "Jack Russell Terrier", "Otter", "Horse"];
```

Wow, that's more terse! It has all the same advantages of the previous version.

### `map` and an arrow function

Thanks to arrow functions, we can shorten up the function expression to:

```js
// When the parameter list is only one element, we can drop () !
let students = [harryPotter, ronWeasley, hermioneGranger, ginevraWeasley];
let patroni = students.map( student => student.namePatronus() )
//=> patroni = ["Stag", "Jack Russell Terrier", "Otter", "Horse"];
```

Wow, things are much less verbose! There is much less noisy JavaScript code so
the _expressiveness_ has increased: "`patroni` is the result of `map`-ing
`students` and asking each for the result of its `namePatronus` method".

For the rest of of these examples, we'll use the arrow function.

## Demonstrate `map()` with Complex Data Structures

Let's use the `map()` function on a trickier data structure â€” a list of robots.
To start things off, we have an array of robots. Now, let's activate all of
them. An activated robot needs to be marked as such using the `isActivated`
boolean, as well as have its number of modes doubled:

```js
const robots = [
  { name: 'Johnny 5', modes: 5, isActivated: false, },
  { name: 'C3PO', modes: 3, isActivated: false, },
  { name: 'Sonny', modes: 2.5, isActivated: false, },
  { name: 'Baymax', modes: 1.5, isActivated: false, },
];

const activatedRobots = robots.map(function (robot) {
  return Object.assign({}, robot, {
    modes: robot.strength * 2,
    isActivated: true,
  });
});

console.log(activatedRobots);

/*
 Result:
 [
   { name: 'Johnny 5', modes: 10, isActivated: true },
   { name: 'C3PO', modes: 6, isActivated: true },
   { name: 'Sonny', modes: 5, isActivated: true },
   { name: 'Baymax', modes: 3, isActivated: true }
 ]
*/
```

With  the native `map()` function that is a property
of `Array`'s prototype. It gives us the exact same result! Now that we know how
map is implemented, it holds no more secrets for us! We can discard our own `map()`
function and just use the `.map()` property on arrays. Sweet!

## Conclusion

`map()` takes 2 arguments--a callback and the optional context. The callback runs
for each value in an array and returns each new value in the resulting array. It
returns a new array that is the same length as the original array and saves time
while making the code simpler and easy to read.
